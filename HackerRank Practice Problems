I used the HackerRank SQL problems to practice writing SQL 

Query the NAME field for all American cities in the CITY table with populations larger than 120000. The CountryCode for America is USA.

SELECT DISTINCT CITY

Find the difference between the total number of CITY entries in the table and the number of distinct CITY entries in the table.
SELECT COUNT(CITY) - COUNT(distinct CITY)
FROM STATION

Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.
The STATION table is described as follows:
SELECT CITY, length(CITY)
FROM STATION
ORDER BY length(CITY) ASC,CITY

LIMIT 1;
SELECT CITY, length (CITY)
FROM STATION 
ORDER BY length(CITY) DESC, CITY
LIMIT 1;

Query the list of CITY names starting with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
SELECT CITY 
FROM STATION
WHERE CITY LIKE 'A%'
OR CITY LIKE 'E%'
OR CITY LIKE 'I%'
OR CITY LIKE'O%'
OR CITY LIKE 'U%'
GROUP BY CITY

Query the list of CITY names ending with vowels (a, e, i, o, u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
SELECT CITY 
FROM STATION
WHERE CITY LIKE '%a'
OR CITY LIKE '%e'
OR CITY LIKE '%i'
OR CITY LIKE '%o'
OR CITY LIKE '%u'
GROUP BY CITY

Query the list of CITY names from STATION which have vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, and u) as both their first and last characters. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
SELECT DISTINCT CITY 
FROM STATION 
WHERE CITY REGEXP '^[aeiou].*[aeiou]$'
