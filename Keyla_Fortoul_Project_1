In this SQL, I query multible tables to find more information about customers and their orders.

#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT count(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND orderID<> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT count (OrderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderID)=6
AND orderID<> 'Order ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT customers.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers AS customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS febuary
ON customers.order_id=febuary.orderID
WHERE length(febuary.orderID)=6
AND febuary.orderID<> 'Order ID'
AND customers.order_id IS NOT NULL
AND customers.order_id <>'';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT Product, MIN(Price) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND orderID<> 'Order ID';

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)*Price 
AS REVENUE
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND orderID<> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY Product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)*Price, Quantity
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
AND length(orderID)=6
AND orderID<> 'Order ID';

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT count(acctnum), AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.customers AS customers
JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales As febuary
ON customers.order_id=febuary.orderID
WHERE length(febuary.orderID)=6
AND febuary.orderID<> 'Order ID'
AND customers.order_id IS NOT NULL
AND customers.order_id <>''
AND febuary.Quantity>2;
